She had designed the hot-pink-accented toys under the brand name I Am Elemental after realizing that girl superheroes on the market were really designed for adult male collectors and “<a href="https://www.newsgram.com/is-the-barbie-doll-hypersexualized-it-was-meant-to-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypersexualized</a>” in a way that didn’t seem appropriate for kids. “We created a figure with a healthier breast-to-hip ratio &#8212; as we like to say, ‘less hooters, more heroine,’&#8221; she says.</p> <p>Within 48 hours, Kerwin had blown though her $35,000 goal and all told, raised about $163,000. But the surprise: Most of the Kickstarter funders weren’t girls or moms of girls &#8212; rather, they were those adult men who like collectibles. And to this day, men make up the majority of her customers, including dads and grandpas who are already action-figure enthusiasts and want something kick-ass-y for the young women in the family. “They are not the target audience but they’ve allowed us to stay in business,” she says.</p> <p>It’s been an unexpected development that Kerwin is pleased about, given her mission is to reinterpret the traditional tiny-waisted, big-boobed female action figure and send a positive message about girl empowerment. “We figured out how to embed these messages inside a toy that they [male customers] already wanted,” she says, with a laugh. “We look like evil geniuses but it’s been an evolutionary process.”</p> <p><em>[Related: <a href="https://thestoryexchange.test/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen to our podcast about inspiring women entrepreneurs</a>]</em></p> <h5>How She Started</h5> <p>Kerwin was inspired to develop I Am Elemental about 18 months before the Kickstarter campaign. A mom of two sons, Kerwin often sent her youngest one, Bram, to her best friend’s house &#8212; and her best friend had young daughters. “When Bram would go to their house, by the end of the day, [the girls] would be in princess costumes and he would be wielding an invisible sword and saving them from monsters,” she recalls. But if the girls came over to Kerwin’s house, which was packed with boys’ toys, “they’d be fully dressed in armor and wielding wands,” she says, “and they would be all saving the day together.”</p> <p>For Kerwin, a Wellesley College graduate, something was amiss in the toy landscape. “We’re not anti-doll or anti-princess,” she says, but ”if you give a girl a different toy, she will tell a different story.” Working with a fellow mom, Kerwin launched I Am Elemental with zero experience running a company. While she had a law degree from Fordham University, Kerwin had chosen to stay at home with her sons, in part because she lost her own mom at age 8.</p> <p>In starting up, “I jumped into the deep end of the pool,” she says. “I knew nothing [but] I love research and reading. That’s my superpower.” While she says she never felt overwhelmed, “we made a lot of mistakes.” To fund the business, she used funds gleaned from the sale of a property she and her sister owned. Then she found designers to actually make the articulated figures, and the team spent months creating  “fierce, strong females worthy of an active, save-the-world storyline.” The figures, manufactured in China, sell for $24.99 each.</p> <p>By the time Kerwin was ready to do the Kickstarter campaign, consumers seemed ready for a strong female character. “We were on the forefront of a cultural zeitgeist,” she says. This was before <i>Wonder Woman</i> (2017) and <i>Captain Marvel</i> (2019) &#8212; two recent groundbreaking movies with female superhero leads. “If we launched the Kickstarter today, it would not have the success,” she says. “We really lucked out &#8212; it was like lightning in a bottle.”</p> <p><em>[Related: <a href="https://thestoryexchange.test/how-to-make-a-difference-through-your-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Seriously Make a Difference Through Your Work</a>]</em></p> <h5>What’s Ahead</h5> <p>Today, I Am Elemental has sold thousands of action figures, though Kerwin declines to disclose specific revenue figures. “We’ve sold to customers in all 50 states and 6 continents, and we ship worldwide,” she says. “We keep multiplying.” While she hasn’t yet taken a salary, she has three paid employees. “Growth is going in exactly the right direction.”</p> <p>In terms of accolades, <i>Time </i>magazine dubbed the products one of its “Top 10 Toys of 2014.” The figures have also been finalists, in numerous years and categories, for the Toy Industry Association’s Toy of the Year Awards. As a result, investors have shown an interest, Kerwin says, but she has always declined. “If we had taken the investor money, we would have been forced into hypergrowth with the goal of selling the company &#8212; and that’s not what we wanted to do,” she says.</p> <p>Instead, Kerwin <a href="http://www.iamelemental.com/jim-henson-company-develop-kids-series-based-iamelementals-female-action-figures/">struck a deal </a>in 2017 with the Jim Henson Company to develop an animated television series based on the female action figures. While production is moving at a “crazy slow” speed, she is excited about seeing her figures on the screen, possibly by year’s end. “Learning a whole new industry has thrilled us,” she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she remains grateful to her male customers, who she describes as “great fans” and supporters. “If you want to change the conversation and create gender equality in our generation, we can&#8217;t only speak to half of the population,” she says. “These are the positive, unintended consequences of what happens when you take a message and you put it in a toy.&#8221;</p> <p><em>[Related: Check out our coverage of <a href="https://thestoryexchange.test/businesses-doing-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women social entrepreneurs</a>]</em></p> <p>[spp-transcript]</p> <div class="swp_social_panel swp_horizontal_panel swp_flat_fresh swp_default_full_color swp_individual_full_color swp_other_full_color scale-100 scale-" data-min-width="1100" data-float-color="#ffffff" data-float="bottom" data-float-mobile="bottom" data-transition="slide"><div class="nc_tweetContainer swp_share_button swp_twitter" data-network="twitter"><a class="nc_tweet swp_share_link" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=She+Designed+Fierce+Female+Action+Figures.+And+Surprise%21+Her+Customers+Are+Men&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthestoryexchange.test%2Fdesigned-fierce-female-action-figures-surprise-customers-men%2F" data-link="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=She+Designed+Fierce+Female+Action+Figures.+And+Surprise%21+Her+Customers+Are+Men&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthestoryexchange.test%2Fdesigned-fierce-female-action-figures-surprise-customers-men%2F"><span class="swp_count swp_hide"><span class="iconFiller"><span class="spaceManWilly"><i class="sw swp_twitter_icon"></i><span class="swp_share">Tweet</span></span></span></span></a></div><div class="nc_tweetContainer swp_share_button swp_pinterest" data-network="pinterest"><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="nc_tweet swp_share_link noPop" onClick="var e=document.createElement('script'); e.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'); e.setAttribute('charset','UTF-8'); e.setAttribute('src','//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r='+Math.random()*99999999); document.body.appendChild(e);"><span class="swp_count swp_hide"><span class="iconFiller"><span class="spaceManWilly"><i class="sw swp_pinterest_icon"></i><span class="swp_share">Pin</span></span></span></span></a></div><div class="nc_tweetContainer swp_share_button swp_facebook" data-network="facebook"><a class="nc_tweet swp_share_link" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestoryexchange.test%2Fdesigned-fierce-female-action-figures-surprise-customers-men%2F" data-link="https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthestoryexchange.test%2Fdesigned-fierce-female-action-figures-surprise-customers-men%2F"><span class="swp_count swp_hide"><span class="iconFiller"><span class="spaceManWilly"><i class="sw swp_facebook_icon"></i><span class="swp_share">Share</span></span></span></span></a></div><div class="nc_tweetContainer swp_share_button total_shares total_sharesalt"><span class="swp_count">0 <span class="swp_label">Shares</span></span></div></div><div class="swp-content-locator"></div></div><footer>
